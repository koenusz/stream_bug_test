# StreamBug

This project is to analyse a bug found in the copying of the church.jpg image

This is an image generated by stabilityAI

after runnig the test "stream the image" there will appear a jpg file calles stream.jpg

The stream.jpg is not a valid image.

The stream.jpg is almost an exact copy of the church.jpg but it is missing a byte

This byte is located at address: 2BE0 0B
The value of this byte is 0D

The compare.sh script will visualize a diff of the 2 files (colordiff needs to be installed)

After manually adding this byte to the copied image it turns into a valid image again.
